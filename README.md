# FIFO_Design_Verification
This project verifies the functionality of an 8-bit FIFO register by implementing a testbench in SystemVerilog.
The aim is to validate the registerâ€™s behavior under various conditions, such as reset, enable, and data input, simulating its functionality in a digital system.
Additionally, by analyzing the register's output and comparing it against expected values, in order to do stimulus generation based checking.
